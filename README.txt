This repository is for a kaggle project to locate and detect objects like roadways, waterbodies, vehicles, buildings etc. in multiband satellite images by DSTL (https://www.kaggle.com/c/dstl-satellite-imagery-feature-detection). The project takes a feature extraction approach towards object classification by building a XGboost decision tree classifier to find objects in test images.

Information about the repository: The repository consists of four folders: code, input and output, scores

Code - It contains two files: CreateGrids.py and GridBased Classification.py.
CreateGrids.py is responsible for setting the grid sizes for an image to extract fatures.
GridBased Classification.py consists code for feature extraction of training and test images, building the classifier model and making the predictions.

input - It contains the following files:
train_wkt.csv - the WKT format of all the training images with its labels.
grid_sizes.csv - the sizes of grids for all the images.
train_geojson.zip - the geojson format of all the training labels.
feature_grid - This folder consists of the feature vectors extracted for test images.
feature_train_grid - This folder consists of the feature vectors extracted for trained images.

output - This folder contains the predictions of class labels generated by the code for test images in the format specified by kaggle.

scores - This folder contains all the scores we got from using different classifiers and by tuning different parameters of the XGBoost model.

Steps to run the program:
Get the three band and sixteen band data from here - https://www.kaggle.com/c/dstl-satellite-imagery-feature-detection/data and store it in the input folder.
Run the gridBased.py file. The code is currently set with configurations giving best results. The output will be generated in the output folder as a csv file.
